    - [ ] Addition (To be fixed)
    - [x] Deletion (❗️Complex ❗️)
    - [x] Auxiliary functions
    
    - [x] To Red-Black trees (To be reviewed)
    
  - For Red-Black trees
  
    - [ ] Research (Not Planned)
    - [x] Addition
    - [x] Deletion
    - [x] Auxiliary functions
    
    - [x] To 2-3-4 trees (To be reviewed)
    
## How to use
Download the code and use an OCamL interpreter on AP3_Projet_G.2.ml
